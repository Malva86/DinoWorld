          <p class="desc film-white">
            Jurassic Park, later also referred to as Jurassic World,[1] is an
            American science fiction media franchise created by Michael Crichton
            and centered on a disastrous attempt to create a theme park of
            cloned dinosaurs. It began in 1990 when Universal Pictures and
            Amblin Entertainment bought the rights to Crichton's novel Jurassic
            Park before it was published. The book was successful, as was Steven
            Spielberg's 1993 film adaptation. The film received a theatrical 3D
            re-release in 2013,[2] and was selected in 2018 for preservation in
            the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress
            as being "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant". A
            1995 sequel novel, The Lost World, was followed by a film adaptation
            in 1997. Subsequent films in the series, including Jurassic Park III
            (2001), are not based on the novels.

          <p class="desc film-color">
            Walking with Dinosaurs is a 1999 six-part nature documentary
            television miniseries created by Tim Haines and produced by the BBC
            Natural History Unit, the Discovery Channel and BBC Worldwide, in
            association with TV Asahi, ProSieben and France 3. Envisioned as the
            first "Natural History of Dinosaurs", Walking with Dinosaurs depicts
            dinosaurs and other Mesozoic animals as living animals in the style
            of a traditional nature documentary. The series first aired on the
            BBC in the United Kingdom in 1999 with narration by Kenneth
            Branagh.[5] The series was subsequently aired in North America on
            the Discovery Channel in 2000, with Avery Brooks replacing Branagh.

          <p class="desc film-white">
            Prehistoric Planet is a British-American five-part nature
            documentary streaming television series about dinosaurs that
            premiered on Apple TV+ beginning May 23, 2022. It is produced by the
            BBC Studios Natural History Unit with Jon Favreau as showrunner,
            visual effects by MPC, and narration by natural historian David
            Attenborough.[1] The documentary follows dinosaurs and pterosaurs
            recreated with computer-generated imagery living around the globe in
            the Late Cretaceous period, 66 million years ago (Maastrichtian),
            just before the dinosaursâ€™ extinction. It set out to depict
            prehistoric life using current palaeontological research by
            including accurately feathered dinosaurs, and probable speculative
            animal behavior.
