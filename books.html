            Dinosaurs Rediscovered: The Scientific Revolution in Paleontology
          </h2>
          <p class="desc book-color">
            In this fascinating and accessible overview, renowned paleontologist
            Michael J. Benton reveals how our understanding of dinosaurs is
            being transformed by recent fossil finds and new technology. Over
            the past twenty years, the study of dinosaurs has transformed into a
            true scientific discipline. New technologies have revealed secrets
            locked in prehistoric bones that no one could have previously
            predicted. We can now work out the color of dinosaurs, the force of
            their bite, their top speeds, and even how they cared for their
            young. Remarkable new fossil discoveries―giant sauropod dinosaur
            skeletons in Patagonia, dinosaurs with feathers in China, and a tiny
            dinosaur tail in Burmese amber―remain the lifeblood of modern
            paleobiology.
          </p>

          <p class="desc book-white">
            Thanks to advances in technologies and methods, however, there has
            been a recent revolution in the scope of new information gleaned
            from such fossil finds. In Dinosaurs Rediscovered, leading
            paleontologist Michael J. Benton gathers together all of the latest
            paleontological evidence, tracing the transformation of dinosaur
            study from its roots in antiquated natural history to an
            indisputably scientific field. Among other things, this book
            explores how dinosaur remains are found and excavated, and how
            paleontologists read the details of dinosaurs’ lives from their
            fossils―their colors, their growth, and even whether we will ever be
            able to bring them back to life. Benton’s account shows that, though
            extinct, dinosaurs are still very much a part of our world.

            The Last Days of the Dinosaurs: An Asteroid, Extinction, and the
            Beginning of Our World
          </h2>
          <p class="desc book-color">
            In The Last Days of the Dinosaurs, Riley Black walks readers through
            what happened in the days, the years, the centuries, and the million
            years after the impact, tracking the sweeping disruptions that
            overtook this one spot, and imagining what might have been happening
            elsewhere on the globe. Life’s losses were sharp and deeply-felt,
            but the hope carried by the beings that survived sets the stage for
            the world as we know it now. Picture yourself in the Cretaceous
            period. It’s a sunny afternoon in the Hell Creek of ancient Montana
            66 million years ago. A Triceratops horridus ambles along the edge
            of the forest. In a matter of hours, everything here will be wiped
            away. Lush verdure will be replaced with fire.

          <p class="desc book-white">
            Tyrannosaurus rex will be toppled from their throne, along with
            every other species of non-avian dinosaur no matter their size,
            diet, or disposition. They just don’t know it yet. The cause of this
            disaster was identified decades ago. An asteroid some seven miles
            across slammed into the Earth, leaving a geologic wound over 50
            miles in diameter. In the terrible mass extinction that followed,
            more than half of known species vanished seemingly overnight. But
            this worst single day in the history of life on Earth was as
            critical for us as it was for the dinosaurs, as it allowed for
            evolutionary opportunities that were closed for the previous 100
            million years.

            The Rise and Fall of the Dinosaurs: A New History of Their Lost
            World
          </h2>
          <p class="desc book-color">
            The dinosaurs. Sixty-six million years ago, the Earth’s most
            fearsome creatures vanished. Today they remain one of our planet’s
            great mysteries. Now The Rise and Fall of the Dinosaurs reveals
            their extraordinary, 200-million-year-long story as never before. In
            this captivating narrative (enlivened with more than seventy
            original illustrations and photographs), Steve Brusatte, a young
            American paleontologist who has emerged as one of the foremost stars
            of the field—naming fifteen new species and leading groundbreaking
            scientific studies and fieldwork—masterfully tells the complete,
            surprising, and new history of the dinosaurs, drawing on
            cutting-edge science to dramatically bring to life their lost world
            and illuminate their enigmatic origins, spectacular flourishing,
            astonishing diversity, cataclysmic extinction, and startling living
            legacy.
          </p>

          <p class="desc book-white">
            Captivating and revelatory, The Rise and Fall of the Dinosaurs is a
            book for the ages. Brusatte traces the evolution of dinosaurs from
            their inauspicious start as small shadow dwellers—themselves the
            beneficiaries of a mass extinction caused by volcanic eruptions at
            the beginning of the Triassic period—into the dominant array of
            species every wide-eyed child memorizes today, T. rex, Triceratops,
            Brontosaurus, and more. This gifted scientist and writer re-creates
            the dinosaurs’ peak during the Jurassic and Cretaceous, when
            thousands of species thrived, and winged and feathered dinosaurs,
            the prehistoric ancestors of modern birds, emerged. The story
            continues to the end of the Cretaceous period, when a giant asteroid
            or comet struck the planet and nearly every dinosaur species (but
            not all) died out, in the most extraordinary extinction event in
            earth’s history, one full of lessons for today as we confront a
            “sixth extinction.”

            Locked in Time: Animal Behavior Unearthed in 50 Extraordinary
            Fossils
          </h2>
          <p class="desc book-color">
            Fossils allow us to picture the forms of life that inhabited the
            earth eons ago. But we long to know more: how did these animals
            actually behave? We are fascinated by the daily lives of our fellow
            creatures―how they reproduce and raise their young, how they hunt
            their prey or elude their predators, and more. What would it be like
            to see prehistoric animals as they lived and breathed? From
            dinosaurs fighting to their deaths to elephant-sized burrowing
            ground sloths, this book takes readers on a global journey deep into
            the earth’s past. Locked in Time showcases fifty of the most
            astonishing fossils ever found, brought together in five fascinating
            chapters that offer an unprecedented glimpse at the real-life
            behaviors of prehistoric animals.

            Dean R. Lomax examines the extraordinary direct evidence of fossils
            captured in the midst of everyday action, such as dinosaurs sitting
            on their eggs like birds, Jurassic flies preserved while mating, a
            T. rex infected by parasites. Each fossil, he reveals, tells a
            unique story about prehistoric life. Many recall behaviors typical
            of animals familiar to us today, evoking the chain of evolution that
            links all living things to their distant ancestors. Locked in Time
            allows us to see that fossils are not just inanimate objects: they
            can record the life stories of creatures as fully alive as any
            today. Striking and scientifically rigorous illustrations by
            renowned paleoartist Bob Nicholls bring these breathtaking moments
            to life.

          <h2 class="title-app">Raptor Red: A Novel</h2>
          <p class="desc book-color">
            Raptor Red is a 1995 American novel by paleontologist Robert T.
            Bakker. The book is a third-person account of dinosaurs during the
            Cretaceous Period, told from the point of view of Raptor Red, a
            female Utahraptor. Raptor Red features many of Bakker's theories
            regarding dinosaurs' social habits, intelligence, and the world in
            which they lived. The book follows a year in Raptor Red's life as
            she loses her mate, finds her family, and struggles to survive in a
            hostile environment. Bakker drew inspiration from Ernest Thompson
            Seton's works that look at life through the eyes of predators, and
            said that he found it enjoyable to write from a top predator's
            perspective.
          </p>

          <p class="desc book-white">
            Bakker based his portrayals of dinosaurs and other prehistoric
            wildlife on fossil evidence, as well as studies of modern animals.
            The book was released in hardcover, paperback, and audiobook
            formats. When released, Raptor Red was generally praised: Bakker's
            anthropomorphism was seen as a unique and positive aspect of the
            book. Criticisms of the novel included a perceived lack of
            characterization and average writing. Some scientists, such as
            paleontologist David B. Norman, took issue with the scientific
            theories portrayed in the novel, fearing that the public would
            accept them as fact, while Discovery Channel host Jay Ingram and
            others defended Bakker's creative decisions as provoking debate and
            bringing science to a wider audience.
